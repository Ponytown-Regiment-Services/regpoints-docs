The Manage Regiment page is where regiment owners and administrators configure core settings: 
names, descriptions, points and patrol settings, ranks and specialties, MWD (K9) options, webhook integrations, and the Discord bot linking tools. 

This guide explains each section in plain language and shows the typical tasks you can accomplish.

## Quick Overview
You will find the page organized into several tabs. 
Each tab controls a different area of your regiment's configuration. 
Changes are applied after you save the form at the bottom (or via the Save button in the floating prompt). 
If you navigate away with unsaved changes, you'll be prompted to save or discard them.

## Main Tabs

<img src="/imgs/manage-regiment/manage-bar.png" alt="The Info tab of the Manage Regiment page, showing fields for regiment name, descriptions, leader name, prefix, and timezone." />
> *The tabs of the Manage Regiment page.*

The main tabs you will use are:

    - [Info](#info-tab--basic-regiment-details) — Regiment name, short and long descriptions, leader name, prefix and timezone.
    - [Points/Patrols](#pointspatrols-tab--how-points-work) — Default points, K9 (MWD) points, min/max patrol points, server names and purge settings.
    - Ranks — Create and edit ranks, set branch names, colors, and promotion thresholds.
    - Specialties — Add special titles that can override a member’s rank display.
    - MWDs — Configure Military Working Dog ranks and modifiers.
    - Order — Fine-tune how ranks are sorted in lists and promotion pages.
    - Discord — Webhook fields, patrol report logo, webhook footer text, and the reglink command to connect your Discord server to the bot.

### Info Tab — Basic Regiment Details

Use this tab to edit the core identity of your regiment.

**Regiment Name** — The full name shown on public pages and the bot.
 
**Short Description** — A concise summary used on lists and previews. 
> Little advice to use 300 characters or less for optimality.

**Leader's Name** — Displayed as the regiment commander.

**Prefix** — Short tag used in some displays, typically 2–6 characters.
> In Work In progress - WIP : `WIP` is what we call the prefix.

**Timezone** — Choose the regiment's timezone. Dates and promotion calculations use this setting — pick the location that matches your leadership team.

**Promotion Week** — Controls when promotions are calculated (Disabled, Odd Weeks, Even Weeks, Last Week of Month).

**Long Description** — Use this for an in-depth regiment bio, rules, or history.

:::tip
Changing the timezone affects date-based features (promotion scheduling and logs). If your leadership spans multiple regions, choose the timezone of the group that makes time-based decisions.
Please also note that the default Timezone is set to CET, Europe/Paris.

### Points/Patrols Tab — How Points Work



This tab controls how many points members earn and server-specific labels used in patrols.

**Default Point Gain** — Base points awarded for a patrol. Patrol leaders use this as the starting value.

**MWD Point Gain** — Separate base points for MWD (K9) members; can follow the default value if you enable "Same as default."

**Patrol Point Min/Max** — Absolute limits members can be awarded on a patrol (prevents accidental outlier values).

:::note
Admins can override min/max patrol points when recording patrols. The purge list respects both inactivity and point thresholds — review it before bulk removals.
:::

**Point Name** — You can rename "points" to any label your group prefers (for example: XP, credits, merit).

**Server Names** — Label up to 3 server slots so patrols can be tied to a specific server name.

Can be use if your regiment operates in ponytown, as well as in DustTown or other games.

**Purge List** — Configure how inactivity and low point totals create purge candidates: set the number of days and point threshold.

:::note[Details]
The way on how the purge list works is that members who have been inactive for over a certain number of days and have less than a specified point threshold will be placed on the purge list. You can modify those amounts in the settings on this tab.
