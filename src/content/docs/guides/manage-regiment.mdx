The Manage Regiment page is where regiment owners and administrators configure core settings: 
names, descriptions, points and patrol settings, ranks and specialties, MWD (K9) options, webhook integrations, and the Discord bot linking tools. 

This guide explains each section in plain language and shows the typical tasks you can accomplish.

## Quick Overview
You will find the page organized into several tabs. 
Each tab controls a different area of your regiment's configuration. 
Changes are applied after you save the form at the bottom (or via the Save button in the floating prompt). 
If you navigate away with unsaved changes, you'll be prompted to save or discard them.

> *The tabs of the Manage Regiment page.*

The main tabs you will use are:

    - [Info](#info-tab--basic-regiment-details) — Regiment name, short and long descriptions, leader name, prefix and timezone.
    - Points/Patrols — Default points, K9 (MWD) points, min/max patrol points, server names and purge settings.
    - Ranks — Create and edit ranks, set branch names, colors, and promotion thresholds.
    - Specialties — Add special titles that can override a member’s rank display.
    - MWDs — Configure Military Working Dog ranks and modifiers.
    - Order — Fine-tune how ranks are sorted in lists and promotion pages.
    - Discord — Webhook fields, patrol report logo, webhook footer text, and the reglink command to connect your Discord server to the bot.

### Info Tab — Basic Regiment Details

Use this tab to edit the core identity of your regiment. Key fields:

    - Regiment Name — The full name shown on public pages and the bot.
    - Short Description — A concise summary used on lists and previews (Twitter-length).
    - Leader's Name — Displayed as the regiment commander.
    - Prefix — Short tag used in some displays, typically 2–6 characters.
    - Timezone — Choose the regiment's timezone. Dates and promotion calculations use this setting — pick the location that matches your leadership team.
    - Promotion Week — Controls when promotions are calculated (Disabled, Odd Weeks, Even Weeks, Last Week of Month).
    - Long Description — Use this for an in-depth regiment bio, rules, or history.

:::tip
Changing the timezone affects date-based features (promotion scheduling and logs). If your leadership spans multiple regions, choose the timezone of the group that makes time-based decisions.
Please also note that the default Timezone is set to CET, Europe/Paris.
