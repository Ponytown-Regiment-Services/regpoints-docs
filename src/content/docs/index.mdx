## What is Regpoints?

Reg(i)point is a point system reserved for the Ponytown [Regiment community](https://ponytown.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Regiments).

It was created in 2020 by Nemm. Unfortunately, the project was shut down in 2023 due to financial issues.

In 2025, Ponytown Regiment Services contacted Nemms, with the assistance of Project: Colorfes, to retrieve the Regpoints files and get them operational again.

What you're about to use is a legacy, nostalgic version of Regpoint as it was in 2023, before the shutdown. The code has been revised to ensure compatibility with recent versions of PHP and other tools.

Regpoints is currently in an Alpha state, as the code rework has not been completed. It is currently on an **Invite-only** system. Meaning, only current PRS staff can invite new regiment.
